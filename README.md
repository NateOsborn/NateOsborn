# Nathan Osborn

**Technical Problem-Solver | Web and Data**

---

I'm a UK-based developer with a non-traditional path into tech. After years in retail and customer service, I returned to education in my thirties, earning a <span style="color:#F97316">**BSc (Hons) Computing & IT with Design (2.1)**</span> from The Open University, and more recently an <span style="color:#F97316">**IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**</span>.

My journey has taken me through <span style="color:#F97316">**game development**</span> with Unity and Godot, <span style="color:#F97316">**full-stack web applications**</span> with Node.js and MongoDB, and most recently <span style="color:#F97316">**AI code evaluation**</span> where I assess AI-generated code for accuracy and engineering best practices.

I bring a methodical approach to problem-solving, shaped by years of independent project work and a genuine passion for building things that work well.
