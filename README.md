- 👋 Hi, I’m @NateOsborn
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, full stack web development, graphic design, UI/UX, music, animation and art!
- 🌱 I recently graduated with a 2.1 BSc(Hons) in Computing and IT and Design from The Open University. Taught myself web development, and game development alongside the degree and I am still learning new things and revising old things every day.
- 💞️ I am hoping to build a portfolio of my code practice on here and I may drop some of my early game dev here, once I have newer games out there...
